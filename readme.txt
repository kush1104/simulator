Charges and Electric Fields Simulator Readme

This program is a physics simulator in which the user can place positive and negative charges on a blank canvas and generate an electric field. The simulator uses vector fields and physics formulas to simulate forces, velocity, acceleration, voltage, potential energy, and kinetic energy. 

Pythonâ€™s standard GUI package TkInter is used, but no nonstandard libraries or modules are used. To run this program, nothing extra needs to be installed as long as the computer has Python. The code just needs to be run on an IDE that supports the latest version of Python (Spyder was used for creating this program). The Barebones code was used for this program and is cited within the code. 

In this simulator, the distance between two arrows on the electric field is 1 meter and the charges are 1 nanocoulomb. The electric field and voltages are calculated and displayed using those 2 values. There are 3 different modes: Path Mode, Motion Mode, and Function Mode. 

Path Mode allows the user to create paths for the particles on the field, Motion Mode causes the particles to exert forces on each other, and Function Mode allows the user to type in and display vector fields. 

Overall, the main purpose of this program is for users to be able to gain an understanding of electric charges and fields. By using all the modes and playing with the charges and sensors, a user can start to understand how charges and fields work and how they interact with one another.
